# Analyzing-Risk-of-COVID-19

This project analyzes and models which MMSA (Metropolitan or Micropolitan Statistical Areas) have the highest total at risk poluation of contracting COVID-19. 

This project is based on the dataset and analysis provided by FiveThirtyEight. The dataset can also be found in this repository's `Data` folder. The original FiveThirtyEight dataset can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/covid-geography. For definitions, calculations, and assumptions, please visit the FiveThirtyEight github repository of the covid-geography dataset.
