# Analyzing-Risk-of-COVID-19

This project explores, analyzes, and models which MMSA (Metropolitan or Micropolitan Statistical Areas) have the highest total at risk population of contracting COVID-19. The goal of this project is to demonstrate data manipulation on real-world, messy data, and to build models capturing much of the pattern in the data. 

We dive into

This project is based on the dataset and analysis provided by FiveThirtyEight. The dataset can also be found in this repository's `Data` folder. The original FiveThirtyEight dataset can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/covid-geography. For definitions, calculations, and assumptions, please visit the FiveThirtyEight github repository of the covid-geography dataset. 

This dataset is used in the analysis in this article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/. This project is meant to be a fun demonstration of a data science process. This endeavor is purely a demonstration of a data science project, and is not meant to contest the analysis or findings of the original article.
